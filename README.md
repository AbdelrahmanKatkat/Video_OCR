# Video_OCR

## **1. Project Overview üìù:**

The project aims to extract specific data points from a Battery Testing video, including Voltage, Current, Power, Capacity, and Energy parameters. These data points are crucial for analyzing battery performance and behavior during testing.

## **2. Tool Selection üõ†Ô∏è:**

- **Paddle OCR:** Chosen for its capability to recognize and extract text from images or videos effectively. Paddle OCR has been trained on similar data, ensuring accurate extraction of the required information from the Battery Testing video.

## **3. Data Extraction Process üîÑ:**

- **Video Analysis:** The Battery Testing video is analyzed frame by frame to identify and extract text containing the desired parameters.
- **Paddle OCR Integration:** Paddle OCR is integrated into the video processing pipeline to recognize and extract text from each frame of the video accurately.
- **Regex Application:** Regular expressions are applied to the extracted text to identify patterns corresponding to Voltage, Current, Power, Capacity, and Energy data points.
- **Data Compilation:** The extracted data points are compiled and organized into a structured format, such as an Excel file, for further analysis and processing.

## **4. Integration and Automation ü§ñ:**

- The project focuses on automating the data extraction process to streamline analysis and ensure consistency in the extracted information.
- Integration of Paddle OCR and regex allows for a robust and efficient extraction workflow, minimizing manual intervention and optimizing resource utilization.

## **5. Quality Assurance and Validation ‚úÖ:**

- To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the extracted data, rigorous quality assurance measures are implemented.
- Validation checks are performed to verify the correctness of the extracted parameters and identify any discrepancies or errors in the extraction process.
